# python-challenge
Bootcamp Module 3


This was fun!  But, overwhelming.  There are so many possibilities and things I wanted to explore.  
I kind of got lost down a python rabbit hole trying new things that absolutely didn't work with other lines I had scripted and ended up with a big ole jumbled mess.  
The PyBank one runs as expected.   
The PyPoll one I'm not happy with and know I can do betteer. 
I over-complicated it, then over-corrected by over-simplifying it.  
I did this over and over and over again.  
I was playing around with getName, various options for dictionary keys/values (with) While, cleaning up and re-writing the csv, magic methods and list slicing.  
I can't wait to learn the rest of it. I also fiddled around with the various ways to write and export files with data output.  
I had to play around with csv.reader and csvreader because I over coded it, had 400 lines of code (when 14 would have sufficed). 
Then I didn't match my own syntax and had to go back and make sure everything matched just so it would run, at all.   
I was hoping to have this incredibly advanced, impressive code.  That is NOT what I ended up with.  I should probably master the basics first... 


Challenge Overview


Three counties participated in this election: Denver, Jefferson and Arapahoe.  Among the 3 counties, 369,711 votes were cast. 
Their vote contributions are as follows:

*Denver:     306,055 votes,  comprising 82.8% of the votes - had the highest voter turnoput



Jefferson:  38,855 votes,    comprising 10.5% of the votes


Arapahoe:   24,801 votes,    comprising 6.7% of the votes



The breakdown of the 3 votes received by each of the candidates are as follows:

Charles Casper Stockham:  85,213 votes,   comprising 23% of the total vote count


*Diana DeGette:           272,892 votes,  comprising 73.8% of the total vote count - she was the winner by a substantial margin


Raymon Anthony Doane:     11,606 votes,   comprising 3.1% of the total vote count

The script, in theory, could be fairly easily re-worked and reused to analyze other elections, in a broad scope. 
(I say in theory because, assuming mine worked better, it could be reused.  However, mine would have to be re-written entirely for it to be translatable in any capacity.)  
The datasetwithin the resources was limited.    
It does not take anything into consideration beyond Candidate, County and Vote count; 
So, it's not really usable for looking at detailed statistics for an election as using those results for future predictions or voter campaigning.  
But, it is efficient enough to use in other small scale electtons where the the scope does not need to be well defined.  
If it is to be used for an election that is much larger in scale, it would need to be re-written altogether,
otherwise it would be entirely too redundant and hard to detail without adding in unnecessarily verbose lines and variables.

# python-challenge
Bootcamp Module 3


This was fun!  But, overwhelming.  There are so many possibilities and things I wanted to explore.  I kind of got lost down a python rabbit hole trying new things that absolutely didn't work with other lines I had scripted and ended up with a big ole jumbled mess.  The PyBank one runs as expected.   The PyPoll one I'm not happy with and know I can do betteer.  I over-complicated it, then over-corrected by over-simplifying it.  I did this over and over and over again.  I was playing around with getName, various options for dictionary keys/values (with) While, cleaning up and re-writing the csv, magic methods and list slicing.  I can't wait to learn the rest of it. I also fiddled around with the various ways to write and export files with data output.  I had to play around with csv.reader and csvreader because I over coded it, had 400 lines of code (when 14 would have sufficed) then I didn't match my own syntax and had to go back and make sure everything matched just so it would run, at all.   I was hoping to have this incredibly advanced, impressive code.  That is NOT what I ended up with.  I should probably master the basics first... 

...On that note, I would like to take another go at it, but first first I need to finish my other homework assignment and study what we are doing now, then I'll back pedal.
